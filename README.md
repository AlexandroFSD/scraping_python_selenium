![Scraping Python Selenium](https://ibb.co/QX5nZqd)<br>
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that leverage the Selenium library to automate web browser interactions. These scripts provide functionalities for various web scraping and testing tasks.

## Key Features:
* __Parsers:__ Extract and process data from web pages using a variety of parsing techniques.
* __Anti-Detection with Tests:__ Implement strategies to evade website anti-bot measures, along with tests to verify effectiveness.
* __Internal Links Scanner:__ Discover and explore internal links within a website to navigate its structure.
* __Form Filling and Submission:__ Automate the process of filling out and submitting web forms with data.
* __Element Finding:__ Locate specific elements on web pages using various methods like XPath, CSS selectors, or more complex criteria.
* __Button Clicking:__ Simulate button clicks and trigger associated actions with ease.
* __Scrolling Elements:__ Scroll web pages to access hidden content or specific sections.
* __Screenshot Capture:__ Take screenshots of the entire page, visible content, or individual elements for visual reference.
* __Event Waiting:__ Implement explicit and implicit waits to ensure elements are loaded before interacting with them, preventing errors.
* __JavaScript Execution:__ Execute JavaScript code within the browser context to perform tasks beyond Selenium's core capabilities.
